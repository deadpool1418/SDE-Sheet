Day 1:
1. Set MAtrix To Zero :
	Use first row and column as buffer to set respective row and column to zero.
2. Pascal Traingle :
	Fomula to calculate value at perticular place r-1 C c-1.
3. NextPermutation :
	It is all the possible arrangements.
	1. Traverse reverse and check a[i] < a[i+1] --> ind1
	2. Traverse reverse and check a[i] > a[ind1] --> ind2
	3. Swap ind1,ind2
	4. Swap ind1+1 to last.
4. Kadne's Algorithm :	
5. SortColors :
6. Buy and Sell Stock:
	Traverse array keep left minimum and calculate profit for each day.
7. Rotate Matrix:
	Take Transpose of matrix (rows becomes columns).
	Reverse every row of matrix;
8. Merge Overlapping Intervals :
9. Merge Two Sorted arrays.

Day 2:
